 I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one 
 of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from 
 college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a 
 college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. 
 That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. 

The first story is about connecting the dots.
 I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then 
 stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before 
 I really quit. So why did I drop out? 
It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, 
unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. 
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, 
so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer 
and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last 
minute that they really wanted a girl.
